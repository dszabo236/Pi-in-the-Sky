- Quad-copter
- Pressurized Air Rocket
- Catapult
- Potato Cannon
# Plan #1 - Hot Air Balloon
We originally chose to design a hot air balloon. We felt like the main challenge would be with the design of the balloon and figuring out what systems we wanted on board.
Important things to note are:
- How to stop the balloon from rising
- Release the Raspberry Pi
- Get enough lift
- Hold the materials under the balloon
## Materials
- Nichrome
- Light, Large, Bag
- Styrofoam
- Pi
- Altimeter
- Gyroscope
- Relay (for current)
- Heating device (heat gun, hair dryer, blow torch)
## Pseudo Code
// initialize Accelerometer

// initialize Altimeter

// start recording

// loop for a minute

// write to .txt file

// relay after two minutes
