## Initial Ideas
- Hot Air Balloon
- Water Rocket
- Quad-copter
- Pressurized Air Rocket
- Catapult
- Potato Cannon
# Plan #1 - Hot Air Balloon
We originally chose to design a hot air balloon. We felt like the main challenge would be with the design of the balloon and figuring out what systems we wanted on board.
Important things to note are:
- How to stop the balloon from rising
- Release the Raspberry Pi
- Get enough lift
- Hold the materials under the balloon
## Materials
- Nichrome
- Light, Large, Bag
- Styrofoam
- Pi
- Altimeter
- Gyroscope
- Relay (for current)
- Heating device (heat gun, hair dryer, blow torch)
## Pseudo Code
// initialize Accelerometer

// initialize Altimeter

// start recording

// loop for a minute

// write to .txt file

// relay after two minutes

# Final Plan
## Materials
- PVC pipe
- Spark plug
- Trigger
- 5 feet of 1.5" ABS (DWV) pipe
- 2 feet of 3" ABS pipe
- A 3" to 1.5" reducer
- A 3" threaded adapter
- A 3" end cap
- A BBQ ignitor (+1 Screw)
- ABS cement
- Cheap aerosol hairspray
## Description
A potato cannon is the most basic form of combustion cannon. Easy and cheap, it has been adapted by DIY'ers many times. In its most fundamental design, a potato is shoved down a pipe that is connected to a compartment where a flammable gas is sprayed and then ignited. The combustion reaction pushes the potato out of the pipe at a high velocity. There is obviously some worry about the force of the projectile damaging the Pi, but part of the project will be figuring out how to effectively protect it. The Cannon itself will be made of PVC pipe.
